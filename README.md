# My REACT Product Management App demo

This project is Product management App that renders the list of Product to the end user.

## Steps to run the Product management App
1) Copy the clone URL for this project
2) Go to the directory on your local machine where you want the Project to reside and run the command " git clone copied-URL-in-step-1-above" 
3) cd to the newly cloned directory and run the command "npm install" - this will download all the relevant dependencies your Project needs in order to run
4) FINALLY, run the command "npm start" to start your Project



The page will reload if you make edits.\


## NOTICE
Currently the Project is getting the Product-data from the "products.js" object, but the final aim is to extrac the data from an external source ie. Excel or a database

# Requirement
10 write a function that will extract the data from an external source and convert the data into an array object which can then be passed to the ReactFlexyTable and then rendered in a table format to the end user.
